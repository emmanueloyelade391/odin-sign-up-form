# Demonstrated Skills
In this project, I will be demonstrating my skills with html forms on a beginner level. This project will specifically include a simple form layout, form validation, styling the form with CSS, and using position properties to control the layout of the entire webpage. The user will be able to enter some information and then submit the form.
